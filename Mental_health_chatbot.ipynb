    "# Mental Health Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## SDGs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chatbots\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbots are computer programs that simulate human conversation with an end user. They are used for a variety of purposes, including customer service, marketing, and entertainment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbots can be broadly categorized into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule-based chatbots**: These chatbots follow predefined rules and patterns to respond to user queries. They are relatively simple to build but lack flexibility and can only handle a limited range of questions. Furthermore, they are not able to produce new text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine learning chatbots**: These chatbots utilize machine learning algorithms to learn from user interactions and improve their responses over time. They are more complex to build but offer greater flexibility and can handle a wider range of queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How chatbots work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User Input: The user types or speaks a query.\n",
    "2. Preprocessing: The input is cleaned, tokenized, and transformed into a suitable format.\n",
    "3. Intent Recognition: The chatbot identifies the user's intent (e.g., asking a question, making a request, providing feedback).\n",
    "4. Entity Extraction: Relevant entities are extracted from the query (e.g., product names, locations, dates).\n",
    "5. Response Generation:\n",
    "  - Rule-Based Responses: Predefined responses for specific intents.\n",
    "  - Generative Models: Generating text from scratch, using natural language processing.\n",
    "6. Response Delivery: The chatbot delivers the generated response to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, two machine learning approaches for natural language processing (NLP) are described and compared. They use the seq2seq architecture as described in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Seq2seq\n",
    "\n",
    "Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) is a type of neural network architecture commonly used in machine learning, particularly for tasks involving sequential data. It is well suited for chatbots because it allows the model to process an input sequence (e.g., a user's query) and generate an output sequence (e.g., a chatbot's response):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encoder:**\n",
    "   * Takes an input sequence (e.g., a sentence) and processes it word by word.\n",
    "   * Each word is represented as a numerical vector.\n",
    "   * The encoder processes these vectors sequentially, capturing the underlying meaning and context.\n",
    "   * The final state of the encoder, often called the \"context vector,\" encapsulates the essence of the input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decoder:**\n",
    "   * Generates the output sequence, one token at a time (e.g., word by word).\n",
    "   * It starts with a special \"start\" token and uses the context vector from the encoder as initial input.\n",
    "   * At each time step, the decoder predicts the next token based on its current state and the previous output token.\n",
    "   * This process continues until a special \"end\" token is generated, indicating the end of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following aspects need to be considered, especially when comparing Seq2Seq models to classical rule-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Positive aspects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Seq2Seq models can capture the context of a conversation, allowing for more relevant and coherent responses.\n",
    "* They can generate novel text.\n",
    "* They can handle complex and open-ended queries that require understanding and reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Negative aspects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Requires large amounts of high-quality training data to create usable models.\n",
    "* Can be computationally expensive to train and deploy.\n",
    "* May sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationship to common ML concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem type\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of chatbots, the primary problem being solved is **sequence-to-sequence generation**. This involves taking a given input sequence and generating a corresponding output sequence. This problem is fundamentally different from classification, where the goal is to assign a fixed label to an input.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "A common loss function used for seq2seq tasks is **cross-entropy loss**. It measures the difference between the predicted probability distribution over possible output sequences and the actual probability distribution (the ground truth).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determining the number of classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of sequence-to-sequence generation, the concept of *classes* is not directly applicable. Instead, approaches deal with a vast vocabulary of words and phrases that can be used to construct responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of potential output tokens (words or subwords) determines the size of the output vocabulary. This vocabulary size can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed vocabulary:** A predefined set of words or tokens that the model is trained on.\n",
    "2. **Dynamic vocabulary:** A vocabulary that expands as the model encounters new words during training or inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of vocabulary size depends on factors such as the specific application, computational resources, and the desired level of language complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The input sequence is 'What day is it?'\n",
    "\n",
    "The output sequence is 'It is Monday.'\n",
    "\n",
    "The vocabulary consists of the used output tokens, in this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "['It', 'is', 'Monday', '.']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the number of classes to predict would be equal to 4 for this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, much more training data is used, resulting in far greater vocabularies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention Mechanism in Encoder-Decoder Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional encoder-decoder models, the encoder processes the input sequence and compresses it into a fixed-length vector, known as the context vector. The decoder then uses this context vector to generate the output sequence. However, this approach can be limiting, especially for long input sequences, as it's difficult to capture all the relevant information in a single vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention Mechanism** addresses this limitation by allowing the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence at different timesteps during the decoding process. It does this by assigning weights to different parts of the input sequence, indicating their relevance to the current output token:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encoder:** The encoder processes the input sequence and generates a hidden state for each input token.\n",
    "2. **Decoder:**\n",
    "    - At each timestep, the decoder calculates an attention score for each encoder hidden state.\n",
    "    - These scores represent the relevance of each encoder hidden state to the current decoder state.\n",
    "    - The scores are then normalized using a softmax function to obtain attention weights.\n",
    "    - The attention weights are used to compute a weighted sum of the encoder hidden states, creating a context vector that is specific to the current decoding step.\n",
    "    - The decoder uses this context vector, along with its previous hidden state, to generate the next output token.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input sequence, leading to more accurate outputs.\n",
    "* By selectively attending to different parts of the input, the model can handle longer sequences more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "An attention mechanism is used in the second approach of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BLEU score\n",
    "\n",
    "**BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)** is a metric used to evaluate the quality of machine-generated text, particularly in the context of machine translation, but also chatbots. It compares the generated text to one or more reference translations (answers) created by human experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does BLEU work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **N-gram Precision:**\n",
    "   - It breaks down the generated text and reference answers into n-grams (sequences of n consecutive words).\n",
    "   - It calculates the precision of each n-gram, which is the proportion of n-grams in the generated text that also appear in the reference answers.\n",
    "   - Typically, n-grams of different lengths (e.g., unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and four-grams) are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Brevity Penalty:**\n",
    "   - To avoid overly short answers that might have high precision but lack content, a brevity penalty is applied.\n",
    "   - If the generated text is shorter than the reference answers, a penalty is imposed to discourage overly concise outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Geometric Mean:**\n",
    "   - The final BLEU score is calculated as the geometric mean of the precision scores for different n-grams, weighted by their importance.\n",
    "   - This ensures that the model is rewarded for producing accurate answers at multiple levels of granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A higher BLEU score indicates that the machine-generated text is more similar to human-quality answers.\n",
    "- However, it's important to note that BLEU is not a perfect metric. It can be sensitive to certain linguistic nuances and may not fully capture semantic similarity.\n",
    "- A high BLEU score should be combined with human evaluation to assess the overall quality of the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "BLEU scores are used to compare the approaches presented in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mental Health Chatbot project outline\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the most important facts about this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of approaches to compare: 2\n",
    "- Architecture type: seq2seq\n",
    "- Dataset used: Mental health questions and answers consisting of 97 rows\n",
    "- Model input size: equal to the number of tokens in the question vocabulary\n",
    "- Model output size (classes): equal to the number of tokens in the answer vocabulary\n",
    "- Loss function: cross-entropy loss\n",
    "- Number of epochs: Models are trained until they start to overfit\n",
    "- Model evaluation: comparison of BLEU scores\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences of the two approaches are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- More sophisticated creation of the input and output vocabularies in the second approach\n",
    "- Encoder/decoder model of the second approach uses an attention mechanism"

While it can take a few weeks to really see improvements with many antidepressants, it\\u2019s still a good idea to talk to your doctor about what to expect. \\n Talk to the doctor that prescribed your medication if you experience symptoms or side effects that are distressing you. If you want to talk to a trusted professional about the most common side effects, call your pharmacist. You can reach a pharmacist by phone after-hours by calling 811. \\n It\\u2019s also best not to stop taking the medication or changing the dose on your own without first talking to a health care provider. While it might be tempting to stop taking your medication when you start feel better, it\\u2019s important to follow your doctor\\u2019s instructions. \\n In some cases, people can have an allergic reaction to a medication. Some reactions are not serious, like a rash. In these cases, you can call the pharmacist or call 811 to reach help after-hours. If you have a serious reaction like difficult breathing, dizziness, or confusion, call 911 right away. \\n When you start a new medication, your pharmacist will give you a printout with information like side effects, signs of an allergic reaction, how long it might take to work, and other information. It\\u2019s good information to keep on hand, but it isn\\u2019t always easy to read. When you pick up your medication, you can ask the pharmacist to go over the information with you so you understand what you should look for. \\n If a particular antidepressant or psychiatric medication just isn\\u2019t working for you, there are many different options! Unfortunately, finding the right medication can take some trial and error. Different people can have very different experiences with the same medication, and often you need to try something to see if it works (or doesn\\u2019t work) for you. This can be a frustrating process, especially when you want to start feeling better, but it\\u2019s important to keep trying and work with your doctor so you understand your options. Many people feel intimidated talking to health professionals, but it\\u2019s important to share information so you both understand what\\u2019s going on and can make good, informed decisions about your health care. Some people also feel embarrassed talking about symptoms or side effects like changes in sex drive or digestion, but its important information for your doctor (and they know that changes in sex drive or digestion are common concerns). You can find strategies, including a mood journal, to help you work with doctors and other health care providers in our Working With Your Doctor toolkit.\",\n          \"Cannabis smoke, for example, contains cancer-causing toxins. However, the risk of developing some cancers (e.g., mouth, tongue and lung) is less for cannabis smokers than tobacco smokers, partly because they tend to smoke less than tobacco users. And, while all drugs have an effect on the brain, the particular properties of the drug influence the level of risk of harmful consequences. The negative effects of cannabis on the brain, for example, seem to be less than the effects of some substances such as alcohol. \\n Legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to put in place regulations to minimize potential harms. The danger of buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it. Cannabis is legal in Canada as of October 17, 2018. Adults (over age 19 in BC) are now permitted to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in public. Cannabis is regulated by the Province of British Columbia and will be sold through the Liquor Distribution Branch. Cannabis will be tested for quality. \\n When drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system, it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking. This helps us manage the risks. However, it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system. It is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold, mildew, or fillers that may be toxic. \\n The legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities. When dealing with complex issues, like cannabis policy, no one has all the answers. But as community members, we all have thoughts, feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other. Engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use, as individuals and communities, in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm. \\n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information. The institute is dedicated to the study of substance use in support of community-wide efforts aimed at providing all people with access to healthier lives, whether using substances or not.

It then trains `training_model` on `encoder_input_data` and `decoder_input_data` (the input sequences for the encoder and decoder) to predict `decoder_target_data`, with training running for the specified number of epochs and batch size, and using 20% of the data for validation. Finally, the trained model is saved to a file named `training_model.keras` for future use."

       " \"Distraction is a very valid tool to help you cope when everything feels overwhelming or when you feel lonely or isolated. \\n If you don't have a lot of energy or focus right now, try low-effort distractions like watching TV, browsing Youtube, listening to a podcast or audiobook, playing a game on your phone, reading an easy book or magazine, or working on a simple art project. \\n If you have more energy and focus, give yourself a to-do list every day: you can clean and take care of projects around your home, work on hobbies, connect with family or friends, read a new book and catch up on your favourite TV shows. You can find interesting opportunities to take online courses from universities all over the world through MOOCs and other online learning platforms, you can learn a new language online or through apps, and you can learn new hobbies and activities. As more people have to practice social distancing or self-isolation, people are finding creative ways to bring the world into their homes: you can tour museums and art galleries, Skype with a scientist, watch animals at zoos and nature preserves, and more. \\n When normal schedules are disrupted, it's easy to fall into unhelpful habits. Look for ways to keep yourself on track with healthier habits. You could set yourself goals every day or turn activities into a fun competition with friends or family—whoever takes the most language classes wins! \\n Many communities are using social media platforms like Facebook to organize support and help for neighbours. If you are healthy and it's safe to do so, you can sign up to walk dogs, pick up groceries and household supplies, and help others who can't go out at the moment. This can be a great way to make new connections in your area, and helping others is good for your own mental health. Just be sure to follow good hygiene practices and physical distancing—your own health is important.\")"
