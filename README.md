# Overview

This Notebook is designed to demonstrate the application of PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) methodology on a mental health dataset. It showcases how to fine-tune a lightweight language model, TinyLlama, for mental health-related tasks while maintaining efficiency and reducing computational costs.

# Key Features

    Model Architecture: Uses the TinyLlama language model, a compact and efficient transformer-based architecture.
    PEFT with LoRA: Demonstrates fine-tuning by freezing most model parameters and adapting select layers for efficient training.
    Mental Health Dataset: Focused on applications in mental health, enabling tasks such as text classification or sentiment analysis.
    Customizable Pipeline: Easily adaptable for other datasets or downstream tasks.
